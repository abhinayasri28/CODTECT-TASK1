##Overview of the project

###Project:Digital Logic Design With Verilog

###Objective
The objective of this project is to perform digital logic design and effectively implement and simulate complex digital systems using Verilog HDL. This course aims to equip students with the skills to design, analyze, and optimize digital circuits for real-world applications.

###Key Activities:
 - **Learning Digital Logic Fundamentals:** Understanding basic concepts such as Boolean algebra, logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits.
 - **Verilog Coding:** Writing and testing Verilog code to describe and model digital circuits.
 - **Simulation and Debugging:** Using simulation tools to verify the functionality of Verilog designs and debugging any issues.

  ##Technologies Used
- **Verilog HDL:** A hardware description language for modeling and designing digital systems.
- **Simulation Tools:** Software like ModelSim, VCS, or Synopsys to simulate and verify Verilog code.
-**Synthesis Tools**: Tools like Xilinx Vivado, Synopsys Design Compiler, or Cadence Genus to convert Verilog code into gate-level netlists for implementation.
-**FPGA Development Boards:** Hardware platforms like Xilinx or Intel (Altera) FPGAs for implementing and testing Verilog designs.
